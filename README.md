## Hi there I'm Allison HidalgoðŸ‘‹

# About Me
I'm a senior at Washington and Lee University. I'm originaly from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm majoring in Earth and Environmental Geoscience with a minor in Computer Science. I'd love to find a way to integrate them and possibly work on modeling environmental challeneges to help people around the world.

This is my emotional support dog, his name is Pablo and he's a nine month old chiweenie!!! He may be small but he has a big personality.

Iâ€™m working on my senior thesis, which focuses on melt inclusions, and Iâ€™m loving it so far. At school, Iâ€™m a menâ€™s lacrosse operations assistant and a member of the cheerleading team! Iâ€™m also a Rho Gamma this year, which has been an interesting experience so far. Iâ€™m not entirely sure what I want to do after graduation, but I think things will work themselves out, so for now, Iâ€™m not too worried.
